Proposal for the Softhorn Calculator Mockup Version:

The proposed mockup version of the Softhorn Calculator features an enhanced user 
interface with a new "Mode" button added to the menu bar, positioned alongside the 
existing help button. The "Mode" button allows users to switch between two variations 
of the calculator: Standard and Scientific.

The Standard calculator retains the current functional capabilities of the calculator, 
while the Scientific calculator offers extended functionality for tasks such as graph 
plotting and BMI calculation, among other useful functions.

Upon selecting the Graph button in the Scientific mode, a new "canvas" is generated, 
displaying a graph of the entered function. Users have the option to store multiple 
functions and compare them on the same canvas, utilizing a Cartesian coordinate system 
for accurate scaling and visualization.

Similarly, selecting the BMI option in the Scientific mode prompts the calculator 
to create a new canvas where users can input their height (in centimeters), age, 
weight (in kilograms), and gender. After inputting the necessary information, the canvas 
closes, and the calculated BMI result is displayed on the screen for the user's reference.

The proposed mockup version of the Softhorn Calculator combines enhanced functionality 
with a user-friendly interface, offering a seamless and professional user experience.
